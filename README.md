Although not very fun or functional, this project taught me a lot about CSS.

I was able to keep elements centered as the page size changes.
Learned about max-width and flex.

Will use this to create a cookie clicker clone in the future.

Pressing too fast on Chrome will cause the screen to zoom in. I was able to fix this on Safari.
